            <div class="acoustic-guitar">
                <h1>Acoustic guitar</h1>
                <p>There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar); 
                    the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap).
                     Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an archtop guitar,
                      which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration,
                       amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often 
                       played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually
                        by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking" 
                    can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.</p>

            <div class="electric-guitar">
                <h1>Electric guitar</h1>
                <p>Electric guitars, first patented in 1937,use a pickup and amplifier that made the instrument loud enough to be heard,
                    but also enabled manufacturing guitars with a solid block of wood needing no resonant chamber. A wide array of electronic
                     effects units became possible including reverb and distortion (or "overdrive"). Solid-body guitars began to dominate 
                     the guitar market during the 1960s and 1970s; they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback. As with acoustic guitars,
                      there are a number of types of electric guitars, 
                   including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars,
                    which are widely used in rock music.
        
                   The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the
                    development of blues and rock music, both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar 
                    solos, and in many rock subgenres, notably heavy metal music and punk rock. The electric guitar has had a major influence
                     on popular culture. The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. It is recognized as a primary
                      instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, ska, mariachi, metal, punk, funk,
                       reggae, rock, grunge, soul, disco, and pop.</p>

            <div class="classical-guitar">
                <h1>Classical guitar</h1>
                <p>Antonio de Torres designed an classical guitar in Spain in the 19th century. 
                    The timbre of the sound, its strength and length are determined
                     by the properties of the wood from which the soundboard is made, 
                    its construction, as well as every element of the body and neck.
                    The term modern classical guitar sometimes distinguishes the classical guitar from older forms of guitar,
                     which are in their broadest sense also called classical, or more specifically, early guitars.</p>

            <div class="jazz-guitar">
                <h1>Jazz guitar</h1>
                <p>Jazz guitar may refer to either a type of electric guitar or a guitar playing style in jazz,
                    using electric amplification to increase the volume of acoustic guitars.
                    Jazz guitar playing styles include comping with jazz chord voicings 
                    (and in some cases walking bass lines) and blowing (improvising) 
                    over jazz chord progressions with jazz-style phrasing and ornaments.
                     Comping refers to playing chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations.</p>
